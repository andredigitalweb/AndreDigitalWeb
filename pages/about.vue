                  About Us
                </h3>
                <p class="mb-8">
                  <b>Our history:</b> Humble beginnings and a desire to provide
                  services that help businesses grow, lead us to start a dream.
                  Initially we offered free services to help businesses to cope
                  up from the devastating effects of the pandemic. Our dream
                  journey was not an easy path, a path only a few chose.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-8">
                  <b>Our mission:</b> Businesses and marketing are loyal
                  friends. We at Andre Digital Web Services bridge that gap and
